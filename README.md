# Angular
I want to cover the understanding and various basic features of Angular. 
#### 1. What is Angular?
Angular is a javascript/typescript based framework to develop client side applications. We use techniques we already know in HTMKL,CSS and Javascript to create applications.
* Using Angular, we can create expressive HTML like we can create conditions in HTML itself.
* It supports powerful data binding.
* Angular supports modularity.
* Angular has built-in support for integrating with backend.
